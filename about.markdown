## Who am I

Hi, I'm Nelson! Software Engineer at Syngenta Digital, based in Brazil, interested in Native Android development, architecture and backend integrations. I like to experiment with new technologies and how they make development faster and more efficient. I have a big passion for specialty coffee ☕️. Lately, I have been playing around with Kotlin, Flow, coroutines, and Jetpack libraries, and how they integrate with different technologies, such as gRPC and event-driven microservices.
